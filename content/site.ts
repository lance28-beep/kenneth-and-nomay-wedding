  narrative: `With the grace of God and the blessing of their families, Kenneth and Nomay joyfully invite you to witness and celebrate their union in love.

Their journey together is a testament to faith, patience, and the beautiful ways God brings two hearts together. From the first moment they met to the countless memories they've shared, every step has been guided by His love.

As they prepare to say "I do," they are filled with gratitude for the family and friends who have supported them along the way. This celebration is not just about the beginning of their marriage, but also a moment to honor the love, prayers, and blessings that have brought them to this special day.`,
